👋 Hi, I’m @Mujahid369
👀 I’m interested in web development, particularly using ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages, and MVC.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in ASP.NET Core, optimizing Razor Pages, and enhancing my skills in front-end development with HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
💼 I’ve built a full-fledged BookStore project from scratch, featuring robust CRUD functionality, API integration, and a sleek, responsive design. This project showcases my ability to handle both the back-end and front-end aspects of web development.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve building robust web applications with a focus on efficient back-end development and clean, responsive front-end design.
📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me via my GitHub profile or email me at [Mujahidkhanitf@gmail.com].

⚡ Fun fact: I love to dive deep into code and find joy in solving complex problems, one line at a time.
